AI Crop Detector
================

Overview
--------

The AI Crop Detector is a machine learning project designed to identify different types of crops from images. It utilizes deep learning techniques to classify images of crops into various categories such as jute, maize, rice, sugarcane, and wheat. This project can be useful for farmers, agronomists, and agricultural researchers to quickly identify the types of crops present in a given area.

Features
--------

*   Utilizes a pre-trained ResNet50 model for image classification.
*   Trained on a dataset containing images of various crops.
*   Provides high accuracy in classifying crop images.
*   Can be integrated into web applications for real-time crop identification.

Usage
-----

1.  Train the model using the `train_model.py` script.
2.  Prepare test data using the `prepare_test_data.py` script.
3.  Use the trained model to make predictions on new images with the `predict_image.py` script.
4.  Integrate the model into web applications using the `app.py` script.

Requirements
------------

*   Python 3.x
*   TensorFlow
*   Keras
*   Flask (for web application integration)
*   NumPy
